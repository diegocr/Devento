Devento - Mozilla Extension
---------------

This restartless extension is designed to quickly turn your browser profile into development mode by enabling certain about:config preferences. Additionally, it'll forward any error throw in the Browser/Error Console to the Web Console, which is something I found handy while developing a chrome-context app.

Since as pointed it's restartless, you can disable it at any time and all your preferences will be properly reset to their previous state.

Feel free to give it a try by installing it straight from this repo by using [GitHubExtIns](https://github.com/diegocr/GitHubExtIns)
